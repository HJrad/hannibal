We want to create an IT solution to improve the communication between the citizens and the municipality.
How:
- The citizen can report issues in his/her neighborhood by taking a photo of trash or broken light or damaged street,.. and send them to the municipality.
- The municipality receives the citizen message.
- The municipality can change the issue status (open, progress and done).
- The citizens can track the issues.
- The municipality can send messages to the citizens to inform about meetings, coming construction,...
- The municipality can send surveys.
